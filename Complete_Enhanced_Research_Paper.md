        connect_mongodb(connection_string=MONGO_URI)
    )
    redis_connection = asyncio.create_task(
        connect_redis(connection_url=REDIS_URL)
    )
    
    # Wait for both connections to establish
    mongo_client, redis_client = await asyncio.gather(
        mongo_connection, 
        redis_connection
    )
    
    # Validate connection integrity
    await validate_database_connections(mongo_client, redis_client)
    logger.info("Distributed data stores operational")
    
    return mongo_client, redis_client
```
